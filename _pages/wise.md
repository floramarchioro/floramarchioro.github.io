  In March 2025 I co-funded and organised the Workshop IdEP in Sustainabile Economics (WISE), a three-day student-led workshop for young researchers on sustainable and applied economics. Ludovica Gazz√© (University of Warwick) joined us as keynote speaker, together with young participants from all over Europe.
