I am a PhD Candidate at the Institute of Economics ([IdEP](https://idep.usi.ch/){:target="_blank"}) of Università della Svizzera italiana (USI Lugano), under the supervision of Prof. [Massimo Filippini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rFW0mNUAAAAJ&hl=it){:target="_blank"}. In 2022, I completed the Swiss Program for Beginning Doctoral Students in Economics, offered by the [Swiss National Bank](https://szgerzensee.ch/){:target="_blank"}. Before joining IdEP, I was a research assistant at the [Environmental Economics Research Center](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/environmental){:target="_blank"} of Nova School of Business and Economics.

In Spring 2025, I visited the department of Barcelona School of Economics under Prof. [Mar Reguant](https://mreguant.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. In March 2025, I co-organized the inaugural Workshop IdEP in Sustainable Economics (WISE 2025).

My research focuses on applied economics, with particular emphasis on carbon markets, energy economics and climate risks. More information is available on my [research statement](/assets/Marchioro_RS.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

**I will be on the 2025/2026 academic job market.**
