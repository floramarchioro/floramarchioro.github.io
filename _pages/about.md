I am a PhD Candidate at the Institute of Economics ([IdEP](https://idep.usi.ch/)) of Universit√† della Svizzera italiana, under the supervision of Prof. [Massimo Filippini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rFW0mNUAAAAJ&hl=it). In 2022, I completed the Swiss Program for Beginning Doctoral Students in Economics, offered by the [Swiss National Bank](https://szgerzensee.ch/). Before joining IdEP, I was a research assistant at the [Environmental Economics Research Center](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/environmental) of Nova School of Business and Economics.

In 2025, I will be a visiting researcher at Barcelona School of Economics under Prof. [Mar Reguant](https://mreguant.github.io/). I am also co-organizing the inaugural Workshop IdEP in Sustainable Economics, which will take place in March 2025.

My research focuses on applied economics, with particular emphasis on energy economics, carbon markets and climate risks. More information is available on my [research statement](/assets/Marchioro_RS.pdf).
